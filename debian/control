Description: Simplifies usage of Java Service Provider Interface
 The usage of the Service Provider Interface in Java is a great way to make your
 program more extensible. However, implementing and distributing such an
 Interface is error prone.
 .
 One of the reasons is that the system depends on naming schemes and text files.
 The name of an implementation should be put in a text file, located on the
 classpath in a folder called META-INF/services/<qualified interface name>.
 .
 This project allows the programmer to use an Annotation, @ProviderFor, to flag
 a class as an implementation of a certain interface. During compilation, the
 necessary files are created at the appropriate locations. Also, the class is
 inspected to see if it follows all rules applicable to Service Providers.
 Compile time errors will be generated if those rules are broken, assisting the
 programmer to create more robust code.
